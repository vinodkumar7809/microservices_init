# Eureka-Naming-Server(Port= 8761)
   Ribbon is used to load balancing b/w multiple instances(Nothing  but services are  running of different port) of a service and that multiple instance we have to configure in our configuration file every time whenever new instance would be created and that is not a good practice to disturb service configuration file every time.so i want to to based on load dynamically increase or decrease the instances of a service. To overcome this problem Naming server came into the picture.

# Namig server does
1. To avoid the problem of disturbing config files of services “Naming Server” came. Naming server is a kind of host or a kind of provider which provides active or running instance details of another service.
